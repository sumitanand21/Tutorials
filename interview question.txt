Coding

a) Write a program to store details of employees in a table and do the following. 
    -> Create an employee component.
    -> Table should have ID, Name, Project, Technology, Role.
    -> Sort them in ascending and descending order.
    -> Display the count of employees working under each project, by passing the value from parent to child.
    -> Delete the employee object from the record.

b)  Write a program to display different 4 counters in 4 rows.
   -> Every counter should have a + and - button next to them performing addition and subtraction ops.
   -> The main counter should be displayed at the top which should display the total count of all the 4 counters.
   -> Perform the operation of hiding the counter, if the value of the counter becomes 0.  

Total Count: 
23 + -
32 + -
45 + -
87 + -



c)  Write a program which implements the traffic signal scenario.
   -> Build two components with red, green and orange lights with toggle switches for each respectively. Both of these must be placed opposite to each other      in the UI.
   -> On loading the application, both the signals should be orange.
   -> When the toggle switch for the first signal is “ENABLED”, the green light should glow and the opposite signal should be red. 
   -> When the toggle switch for the first signal is “DISABLED”, the red light should glow and the opposite signal should be green. 
   -> Same should be the case with toggle switches for the second signal.

patients = [
  { id: 1, name: "Rock", age: 54, gender: 'M', bloodGroup: 'B+' },
  { id: 2, name: "Mary", age: 27, gender: 'F', bloodGroup: 'O+' },
  { id: 3, name: "John", age: 78, gender: 'M', bloodGroup: 'A+' },
  { id: 4, name: "Sera", age: 43, gender: 'F', bloodGroup: 'O+' },
  { id: 5, name: "Mike", age: 65, gender: 'M', bloodGroup: 'A+' },
  { id: 6, name: "Tyson", age: 54, gender: 'M', bloodGroup: 'O-' }
]

a) Give me the count of female patients.
b) Remove the records with duplicates in the bloodGroup attribute.
c) If the blood group is O+ add another key "notes" and value as "Universal donor".

b) Sort the array based on age.

  { "brand":"Ford", "model": "Mustang", "withAbs": true },
  { "brand":"Ford", "model": "Figo", "withAbs": false },
  { "brand":"BMW", "model": "X3", "withAbs": true },
  { "brand":"BMW", "model": "X5", "withAbs": true },
  { "brand":"Fiat", "model":"Linea", "withAbs": false }
]

Movies = [‘Avengers’, ‘Inception’, ‘Conjuring’, ‘’Fast and Furious’, ‘Joker’]
