Your task is to complete simple notes application using provided `NotesService` to save and read notes. Keep in mind the following requirements:

### 1. Use NotesService to populate list of notes

- Each item in list should show note title
- Selecting note should highlight it 
- New saved notes should be added to the end of the list and selected
- Changes in form fields should not reflect on the list until note is saved

Note: Do not modify the implementation of `NotesService`.

### 2. Note Form

- Form should be displayed only when note is selected or there is new note
- It should be empty when new note is selected
- When note is selected form should show note details
- Note should be saved when Save button is clicked
- When required fields are empty, error should be displayed

### 3. A bit of style

- When note is set to favorite and saved it should have bigger font (20px)
